                <h5>At Savoir, we're revolutionizing the way retailers run their promotions with our innovative RXD technology.</h5>

                <p>Our proprietary RXD dynamic pricing technology allows retailers to progressively lower their promotional price based on sales performance, to attract more shoppers and drive sales while remaining profitable. Our solution ensures that your promotional prices are sustainable, whilst remaining attractive to your brand followers. Additionally, customers can receive unlimited E-Cashback on their purchases as the price decreases over time. By purchasing early, customers can maximize their savings with E-Cashback in addition to their discount.</p>

                <h5>Our Goal</h5>

                <p>Our goal at Savoir is to empower retailers to confidently and sustainably offer dynamically priced promotions, driving sales and attracting more shoppers while still maintaining above break-even-point (BEP) profitability.</p>
